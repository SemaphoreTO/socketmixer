    In Meshmixer, holding the "Space" bar opens a set of controls which change the way your models are displayed. Most importantly, the buttons in the "Color" section allow you to switch between displaying the original color data from your 3D scan, and displaying what are called "face groups." To toggle between the two views in Meshmixer, simply hold down the "Space" bar and click on either of the two icons in the "Color" area of the pop-up menu.
