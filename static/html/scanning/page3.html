      <h4> Step 7 </h4> 
      <br>

      <p><br />
      Once in the recording tab, adjust the Delay Time and the Limit Time of Scanning.
      For this, drag the mouse cursor until you get the <u><b>time configurations</b></u>
      below. If you find that you require a different time, feel free to change these
      settings.<br />
      <br /></p>

      <div id="roundBox">
        <center>
          <b>Delay Time: 10 Seconds</b>
        </center>

        <center>
          <b>Limit Time: 45 Seconds</b>
        </center>
      </div><br />
      <h4> Step 8 </h4> 
      <br>
      Before scanning, keep in mind the following <u><b>technical requirements</b></u>
      :<br />
      <br />

      <div id="roundBox">
        <center>
          <b>The effective range of the scanner (green area) is 23" (58cm) and 27"
          (68cm), so try to keep as much of the residual limb between this distance.
          Areas shown in red are not being scanned accurately. Moving too quickly may
          result in a failed scan. Instead, move slowly and steadily.</b>
        </center>
      </div><br />
      <br />
      Press the <u><b>Record</b></u> button to start scanning. To scan:<br />
      <br />

      <div id="roundBox">
        <center>
          <b>Move the scanner in a fluid arc around the residual limb, completing a
          360&deg; rota- tion around it. Start from one limb&rsquo;s side holding the
          scan, standing up, holding the scan in your arm lowest position, and scan for
          an entire round ending on the other side of the limb with the scan viewing the
          bottom of the limb.Once a full rotation has been completed, scan the base of
          the residual limb.</b>
        </center>
      </div><br />
      <br />
      <h4> Step 9 </h4> 
      <br>

      Once you have finished the scan, press the Record button again to stop recording if
      the time is still running. The software will then produce a model. The model should
      be complete, with few or no holes, and few imperfections. If the model does not
      look accurate, press the Delete button and attempt another scan.
